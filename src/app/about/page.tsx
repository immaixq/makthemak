                    Hello! ðŸš€ I&apos;m Mai, a data scientist from Singapore.
                    Consider this blog my enchanted diary, where I share nerdy spells, whimsical thoughts, and tales of deciphering data mysteries. 
                    Join me for a blend of tech wisdom and quirky anecdotes.

                    A cup of good coffee makes my day. Perhaps our paths will cross at a random coffee spot one day. Anyways,  
                    <span className="dark:text-amber-400 text-blue-700"> It would make my day if you find anything interesting here. </span>

                    I also find great joy in the process of making things. Whether it is developing a new feature for an application or building this website from scratch, <span className="dark:text-amber-400 text-blue-700">there is something incredibly satisfying about seeing an idea come to life through code.</span>
                    I believe that the ability to create something from nothing is what sets coding apart from other fields, and the prospect of creating something that touches somebody&apos;s life
                    motivates me to continue learning and improving my skills.  I hope to share with others as I continue to grow and develop in this exciting field.
