In the fast-paced realm of modern software development, staying nimble is key. 
Enter container technology‚Äîa game-changer that streamlines the process of deploying and running applications. 
Picture bundling up an app and all its necessities into a neat, standardized package that effortlessly moves from one computing environment to another. 
That's the magic of containers. 
In this brief journey, we'll uncover the basics of container tech, exploring why it's a must-have tool for developers and IT pros.

## Why containeraisation 

You might find this situation familiar at some point of development lifecycle.. 

> But it runs on my computer! 

Here is containeraisation to the rescue. Containeraisation helps to relieve the pain of setting up dependencies and packages when someone else wants to run an application another developer builds. 
This ensures portability, allowing application to run consistently across different environment. It also allows for scalability as containers are light
weight as compared to a virtual machine.

## What is Docker üê≥ 
When we talk about containeraisation, we often tie it with Docker. 
Docker is a gateway to container technology. It is a user-friendly API wrapped around Linux Containers (LXC), which is the pineer of container technology.
Elaborating a little more about LXC, it uses control groups - cgroups to group processes to ensure no one container exhausts all resources. LXC also uses 
namespace to allow processes to have limited users and allows for root privilege for runnning processes. 

Docker has been a commonly used platform to build, deploy and manage containeraised applications and 
a tool to work with container image and containers. In the subsequent examples about containers and images, I will be using Docker to illustrate the code
snippets.

## Building blocks of container
The two major ingredients to get container running are container image and container runtimes. 

### Container image
Container image is a snapshot to record of how the software should behave and pack all necessary building ingredients to execute the container. 
Images are labelled in name and tag which are distributed by container registry. In Docker, the container image is defined using a Dockerfile.
A Dockerfile is a text configuration file that contains a set of instructions for building the image. Here is a simple example of a Dockerfile:

```python
# Pull a Pytorch image as the base image from Pytorch
FROM pytorch/pytorch:latest

# Set working directory in container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements file into container to /app folder
COPY requirements.txt /app/

# Install any dependencies specified in requirements
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Command to run your application
CMD ["python", "your_ml_script.py"]

```

Similar to the construction of a burger, the container image is built with layers. As each modification to the Dockerfile is saved as one layer, 
containers with similar base image can reuse the shared layers, thus keeping containers light weighted.

Elaborating further about the layers of the Dockerfile, the first layer installs the base image of the container. This sets up the initial operating system
of the container, acting as a starting point with default filesystem and programs which can be used to customise the image further.  

### Building the container
To start building the container, simply execute the `docker build` command and Docker will executes the instructions specified in the 
Dockerfile. During the creation of the layers, the layers are cached for efficiency so that changes to the container made subsequently can be directed to 
targeted layers only.

## Container technology in a nutshell
In summary, think of container as planning for a picnic. 
Picture a picnic basket meticulously packed with all your desired essentials‚Äîdelicious food, a cozy mat, and perhaps a couple of bottles of wine to elevate the experience. 
Now, imagine your friend expressing interest in having the exact kind of fantastic picnic you just enjoyed. 
Here's the magic: you can effortlessly hand over your picnic basket, ensuring your friend's picnic runs as seamlessly and joyfully as yours did.
This simple, hassle-free sharing is akin to the essence of container technology in the world of computing.
