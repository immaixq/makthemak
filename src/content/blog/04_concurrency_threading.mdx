Learning about ROS has exposed me to the concept of threading. In this article, we will look into the concept 
of concurrency, threading and parallelism. 

### Concurrency 
> Concurrency: The act of executing many tasks at the same time but the tasks does not imply the sequential processing of tasks. It only requires
the system and the code instructions to be sent to be capable of running more than one task at the same time. 

Concurrency is the ability to deal with tasks in a interleaved manner where each tasks makes some progress in overlapping time
intervals. 

Consider a web server handling multiple client requests, the server can switch between requests, making some progress on each before 
handling the next one. In this case, while the server is tackling one request at a time, it seems like all the requests are being processed
simultaneously.

Concurrency allows for system resource sharing such as memory and declared variable in the code. The advantage of resource sharing can be illustrated with a producer process and a consumer procress. The writer process is responsible for generating
data while the consumer process processes the generated data. Instead of having the generated data to be sent over a network connection, the generated data 
can be stored in the shared memory region which reduces the overhead of file I/O or network communication. 

#### Threading 
Threading is a technique that enables for concurrency. A thread is the minimum sequence of instructions that can be managed independely by a scheduler.
By creating multiple threads, a program perform multiple tasks concurrently. 
Threads share the same memory space and resources within a process, enabling a better inter-process communication which reduces the overall consumption of
resources. 

####  Asynchronous Programming 
Asynchronous programming is a way to achieve concurrency without relying on threading. In asynchronous programming, tasks are not performed in a sequential way.
Asynchronous allows the program to continue to process other tasks while waiting for the original task to be completed. This can be achieved using callbacks, promises, or async/await. 

### Parallelism 
Parallelism is the ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously using multiple processing units such as CPU or GPU cores. 

> Parallelism: The act of dividing tasks into multiple subtasks that can be executed in parallel at the same time, on discrete threads and cores of a CPU or GPU.

#### Things That Can't Do Asynchronous
While running in parallel improves runtime performance, it is important to note that many algorithm cannot be split into subtasks to execute on a pool of cores. 
This is because these algorithms require state maintanence to function properly. Managing shared state is a challenge in concurrency and parallel programming as multiple threads or processes 
may access and modify shared state simultaneously. This leads to race conditions, deadlocks or inconsistent result.
