## Post Reading Thoughts
This blog entry is about my thoughts on reading the "fancy bear goes phishing" by Scott J. Shapiro. 
The book delves into the world of cybersecurity in five influential hacks. This includes the story of 
Robert Morris Jr, who crashed the internet accidentally in 1980s and the Russian intelligence unit 
who managed to access the Democratic National Committee's computer system.

### The style of writing 
One of the aspects I thoroughly enjoyed about the book is Scott J. Shapiro's unique and engaging writing style.
While the stories of the hack is intriguing, I really liked how it was conveyed with little sparkles of technical 
concepts throughout the book. For instance, his explaination of how the internetworking works is memorable as he
relates to the mailing system in the real world. With the comparision between the real world mailing system versus 
the digital version - email, it is easier to grasp the meaning of port, segment, and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). 
The way he introduces technical concepts in such clarity and elegance is the style of writing I would like to learn from. 

### Technical bits gained 
Reading "On Fancy Bear Goes Phishing" has helped me understand several technical concepts better. 
Here are a few key insights,

**What happens when an email is sent?**

When the email `send` button is pressed, the email message is sent to the operating system which runs TCP/IP.
TCP puts the email in an electronic envelope called `segment` and attach the destionation port onto it. `port` 
is like a room in the receiver's computer where incoming mail is processed. Port 80 and 443 are typically used 
for web traffic while port 25 is the standard destination port for email.

When the email message is too big to fit into one envelope, the operating system splits the message into smaller 
parts sequentially and placed into segment each with its destination port and source address. These segments are 
sent to another part of the operating system responsible in fitting these TCP segments into a bigger envelope called packets.

Each packet has its own IP address such as 127.3.45.101. Think of IP address like the home address or postal
code of a computer, that is how the email knows where to go. Finally, the packet is sent to the local network, ready to be
transferred to a router. The router takes the job of a large post office, in charge of sending the message to its destination 
with the most optimal route. After transiting across the country, the message reaches the receiver's local network at last.
The outer IP address on the packet is opened once it has reached the receiver's computer, exposing the inner segment address
which reads port 25. Knowing that the packet is an email, the email application takes over and handle the rest. 

**Explain CPUs to a child**

CPUs are the brains of the computer who only understand and communicate in binary - ones and zeros. 
A compiler is needed to translate high level code which humans can read and write, to low level codes (in binary) which a 
machine can understand. 

**Data versus code**

The computer places information into special memory locations according to their designation. 
A file designated as code is loaded into the code segment while a file designated as data is loaded
into data segment. These segments are kept independently. An instruction pointer is used to identify the point of execution when 
the operating system runs the code. If the intruction pointer point to a data segment, the CPUs will intepret it as 
code and run execution.

**SQL injection**

Understanding SQL injection requires the understanding of what SQL is. 

> Structured Query Language (SQL): is the main language used for databases search on the web

SQL helps to search through databases from the server for an inputted term and returns information related to the search query. 
SQL injection happens when the application inserts malicious sql query without proper validation in the user input fields e.g through login forms.

To illustrate a malicious input, our friendly LLMs gives a great example. Consider a user trying login to an application by entering a regular user name 
and password, the attacker might enter:
```python
Username: admin' --
Password: anything
```

The combination of these inputs will be processed as:
```python
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' -- ' AND password = 'anything';
```
where the `--` is a comment in SQL to ignore everything afterwards. As such, the query becomes:

```python
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin';
```
If there is a user with the username "admin", the query returns the user's data, bypassing the password check. 

**Authentication**

Authentication is the proof of identify. When we use the computer, the username is prompt in the login page. This is
the operating system asking who is knocking the door and going into the OS. After the users identify themselves, 
the users have to provide their credential which serves to prove that the user is indeed who they claim to be.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enhances security by requiring users to provide two or more distinct verification methods, 
typically combining something they know (like a password) with something they have (like a phone for receiving a code) 
or something they are (like a fingerprint), before granting access to an account or system.

### On Moral Duality

There is also a section of the book that talks about moral duality. It emphasizes on the use of any tools are double edged swords.
These tools can be used for good or evil, and it would be dependent on the intention of the person using the tool.

From nuclear technology to AI, the moral duality of tools has been a subject of ongoing discussion throughtout our time.
While the development in nuclear engergy potentially provides us an option to clean energy, it is important to consider the consequence of
nuclear waste disposal and nuclear accidents that pose long term repercussion. While the development in AI enables the next wave of
growth across most industries like healthcare, it can also perpetuate biases present in the training data and raises concerns about 
the risk of unexpected problems like the loss of human judgement. 

Ultimately, it is up to us. 
It is imperative that we develop ethical framworks and regulations to guide its responsible use.
And for me, I would imagine and hope for a world where the good outweights the bad.
