I applied, and surprisingly, I got hired. That summer, I churned out designs and learned more about Adobe Illustrator than I could have imagined. As high school graduation approached, it seemed natural I would continue with design in college (university). But a looming fear of a career as a designer led me to explore other options.

I was worried about job stability and the intense cirriculum for designers at my college. In retrospect, I didn't have great guidance (easy to say in hindsight). Ultimately, I made the jump for engineering.

> **Takeaway:** Chase your passions. You might just learn some valuable skills along the way.
## Becoming an Engineer

I started college and learned to code in 2011. I chose Computer Engineering because I built my own gaming computer once, and I was the "IT" person for my friends and family. Not exactly a strong foundation to build a career upon.

My first class was _Introduction to Computer Programming_. My professor asked, "How many have had prior programming experience?". More than half the class raised their hands. My hand stayed down. I became nervous.

I struggled throughout my first year of school, scraping by with average grades and low self-esteem. I wanted to quit. "I'm not smart enough to be a programmer", I thought. In hindsight, I was actually just _learning the wrong things for me_.
