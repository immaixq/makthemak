Removing duplicated data is a crucial preprocessing step for model training. In computer vision, image hashing is a valuable tool for 
image similarity detection which helps to identify images that should be removed.

### What's Image Hashing
> Image hashing function is a process of transforming input data to a string with a fixed length.

The image hash generated from the hashing function is like a digital fingerprint of an image, which confirms the image's identity.

There are a variety of hashing functions such as average hash, perceptual hash, difference hash, 
Haar wavelet hash, and HSV color hash. Different hashing algorithm arises to tackle different use cases.
Let's dive deeper into the two of these hashing algorithms (average and perceptual hashing) and see how the 
underlying mechanism works! 

### Average Hashing (aHash)
Average hashing is known to be the simpliest hashing algorithm as it takes fewer transformation in its
computation of the resulting hash. The steps in average hashing are:

1. Reduce Image Size - Downsampling & Reduce Color

First, the image size is reduced to 8x8 pixels and the image is converted into grayscale. This removes image details which increases the 
speed of image processing. The 8x8 pixels give a 64 bit hash which is a compact representation of the image.

2. Setting pixel values to bits - By Comparision with Average Pixel values

If the pixel value is greater than the average, hash value is set to 1, otherwise, it will be 0.

```python
from PIL import Image

# average hashing
image = Image.open("avatar.png")

# 1. convert image to grayscale
gray_image = image.convert("L")

# 2. resize image to 8x8
resized_gray = gray_image.resize((8,8))

# convert to pil image object to array
pixels = np.asarray(resized_gray)

# get average pixel value
avg_px = np.mean(pixels)

#  get bits: if pixel > avg_px = 1, else 0
bits = pixels > avg_px

# flatten bits and convert to bit string
bit_string = ''.join(str(bit) for bit in 1*bits.flatten())

# convert to hexadecimal 
hexadecimal_hash = hex(int(bit_string, 2))[2:]  # remove the "0x" prefix

```

3. Convert bit string into hexadecimal equivalent hash

A little side track to examine the counting of hexadecimal equivalent of the 
binary number. 

#### Hexadecimal Numeral System

The hexadecimal numeral system is a base-16  system that uses 16 symbols to represent numbers.
Instead of using 10 symbols 0-9 to represent numbers in the decimal system we commonly
use, hexadecimal uses `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, D` to represent 
values from 0 to 15.

Considering the bit string:

 ```
 0000001000110010011110001011100010111000001110000000100000000001
 ```

It will be grouped into sets of four since each hexadecimal digit corresponds to 
four binary digits.

```
0000 0010 0011 0010 0111 1000 1011 1000 1011 1000 0011 1000 0000 0100 0000 0001
```

The values of the bits are shown as follows:

Next, combine the hexadecimal digits obtained from each group to form the final hexadecimal number:

`023278B8B838041`

The image hash remains the same for a scaled image. Also, changes in brightness, contrast and colors
will not change the hash value significantly. And that's it for average hashing! 

### Perceptual Hashing (pHash)

Perceptual hash function is locality sensitive. That means, similar data points are likely to be mapped 
to the same or nearby hash buckets. Rather than calculating the mean value of the 64 pixels in average
hashing, perceptual hashing uses the mean discrete cosine transformation (DCT) value. 

#### What is Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT)?

One common application for DCT is for image compression which helps to reduce high frequency signals, e.g in JPEG compression. 
The compression starts by splitting the image into 8x8 pixel groups, where each group is encoded with DCT.
In DCT, pixel values of an image are approximated by the sum of many cosine waves at different frequencies.

The steps to perceptual hashing are: 

1. Reduce Image Size - Downsampling & Reduce Color

This step is mainly to simplify the DCT computation.

2. Calculate & Reduce DCT

This step uses DCT to reduce high frequencies signals of the image while preserving the gists of the original image.

3. Set hash bits to 0 or 1 by comparing if DCT value is greater or smaller than the average

This will give us a bit string as shown above, which is then converted into an unique hexadecimal code.
